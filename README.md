# Operational Insights

Staffing vs. Revenue Generated

The analysis of Number of Staffs on Duty vs. Revenue Generated (for staff counts 5-19) shows that revenue remains relatively stable (between 25,000 and 35,000) regardless of minor fluctuations in staff count.

- Conclusion: Within the observed range, increasing or decreasing staff count does not lead to a linear or dramatic change in revenue. Efficiency and service quality appear to be maintained across this range of staffing levels.

Payment Distribution

Payment methods are almost perfectly balanced, indicating the club must maintain robust infrastructure for all options:

- Card: 666 transactions

- Cash: 653 transactions

- Mobile: 641 transactions
